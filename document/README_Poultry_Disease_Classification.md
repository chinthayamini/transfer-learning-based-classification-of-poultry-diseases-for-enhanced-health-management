# Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases

This project focuses on using transfer learning to classify common poultry diseases based on image data, aiding early detection and improved health management in poultry farming.

## 📌 Project Objective
To develop a deep learning model using transfer learning for accurate classification of poultry diseases, improving diagnostic speed and reducing economic losses in poultry farms.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Manual disease identification is slow and prone to errors. The project aims to automate disease detection using deep learning models with transfer learning, especially when data is limited.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Open-source poultry disease image datasets.
- Classes: Healthy, Fowl Pox, Newcastle Disease, Coccidiosis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Image resizing (224x224), normalization.
- Data augmentation: flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments.

### 3. Model Architecture
- Pre-trained Model: ResNet50 (trained on ImageNet).
- Custom classification head: GlobalAvgPooling + Dense + Dropout + Softmax.
- Optimizer: Adam | Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy.

### 4. Training
- Fine-tuning the top layers of the ResNet50 model.
- Validation accuracy achieved: ~92.3%

## 📊 Results
- High accuracy in classifying poultry diseases.
- Confusion matrix and classification reports confirm strong performance across all classes.

## 🚀 Applications
- Mobile apps for farmers.
- Real-time disease monitoring systems.
- Veterinary diagnostic tools.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integration with IoT for real-time detection.
- Expanding dataset with field images.
- Deployment as a cloud/mobile service.
